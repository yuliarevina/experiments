function pix = deg2pix_YR(deg, d, cmperpix)% pix = deg2pix(deg, d, cmperpix)% converts degree visual angle  into pixel at distance d in (cm) from screen% size of pixels constant is set in the program% inverse of PIX2DEG% distance and cmperpix is optional. If not input into the function, then d% is set below (in cm). cm per pixel is also calculated from screenwidth in% cm and horizontal resolution in pixels.% Values below are correct for station 2 in the lab (42cm d, 40cm width, 1152 resoltuion). For the two CRTs. If% using a different lab/computer - change values below.% Code written by Yulia (based on Gerrit's code "deg2pix.m")% April 2017screenwidth = 40; %cmhorizontalresolution = 1152; %pxif nargin < 2    d = 41;    cmperpix = screenwidth/horizontalresolution;elseif nargin < 3    cmperpix = screenwidth/horizontalresolution;endpix = 2*((tand(deg/2)*d)/cmperpix);return
